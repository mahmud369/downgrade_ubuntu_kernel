Downgrading the Ubuntu kernel involves installing an older version of the Linux kernel and then configuring your system to boot from it. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

### 1. **Check Current Kernel Version**
   First, check your current kernel version to ensure you know which one you are using:
   ```bash
   uname -r
   ```

### 2. **List Available Kernels**
   You can check which kernels are available on your system by running:
   ```bash
   dpkg --list | grep linux-image
   ```
   This will display a list of installed kernels. If the version you want to downgrade to is already installed, you can skip to step 4.

### 3. **Install the Desired Kernel Version**
   If the desired kernel version is not installed, you can install it. For example, to install a specific version, run:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install linux-image-<version>
   sudo apt install linux-headers-<version>
   ```
   Replace `<version>` with the actual kernel version number (e.g., `linux-image-5.4.0-26-generic`).

   If the specific version is not available in your repositories, you can download it from the [Ubuntu kernel repository](http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/) and install it using `dpkg`:
   ```bash
   wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v5.4.0/linux-image-5.4.0-26-generic_5.4.0-26.30_amd64.deb
   sudo dpkg -i linux-image-5.4.0-26-generic_5.4.0-26.30_amd64.deb
   ```

### 4. **Update GRUB**
   After installing the older kernel, you need to update GRUB to recognize the new kernel:
   ```bash
   sudo update-grub
   ```

### 5. **Set Default Kernel in GRUB**
   You may want to set the older kernel as the default. To do this, you can manually edit the GRUB configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/default/grub
   ```
   Find the line:
   ```bash
   GRUB_DEFAULT=0
   ```
   Change `0` to the entry number corresponding to the older kernel version (counting starts at 0). Alternatively, you can set the kernel version directly:
   ```bash
   GRUB_DEFAULT="Advanced options for Ubuntu>Ubuntu, with Linux 5.4.0-26-generic"
   ```
   Save the file and then run:
   ```bash
   sudo update-grub
   ```

### 6. **Reboot and Verify**
   Finally, reboot your system:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```
   After rebooting, verify the active kernel:
   ```bash
   uname -r
   ```

### 7. **Remove Unwanted Kernels (Optional)**
   If everything is working fine with the older kernel and you want to remove the newer kernel:
   ```bash
   sudo apt remove linux-image-<newer-version>
   sudo apt autoremove
   ```

This should successfully downgrade your Ubuntu kernel to the desired version.
